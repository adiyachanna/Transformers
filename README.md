## Overview
This project demonstrates the training of a Transformer-based model using the PyTorch framework. The training process is tracked with progress bars (`tqdm`) and includes real-time loss updates and validation checkpoints.

---

## Features
- **Efficient Data Loading**: Uses `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` for batch processing.
- **Transformer Architecture**: Implements encoding, decoding, and projection layers for sequence processing.
- **Real-Time Tracking**:
  - Training loss displayed with `tqdm`.
  - Metrics tracked with TensorBoard.
- **Validation Pipeline**: Includes evaluation and performance logging.
- **Checkpointing**:
  - Saves model weights, optimizer state, and global step after every epoch.
